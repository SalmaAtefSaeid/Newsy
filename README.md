<p id="description">This app leverages NewsAPI to retrieve a variety of news sources each offering top headlines. It utilizes Alamofire to fetch news sources and headlines from the API displaying them through a SwiftUI interface. Core Data is implemented for offline functionality: the app initially loads data from the database and subsequently checks for fresh content from the API. The API is called only when the database is empty or if the app has been open for 30 minutes.</p>
